      Relationships are expressed using the following terms:

      **outgoing_status**: Your relationship to the user. Can be "follows",
        "requested", "none".
      **incoming_status**: A user's relationship to you. Can be "followed_by",
        "requested_by", "blocked_by_you", "none".

      At this time, uploading via the API is not possible. We made a conscious
      choice not to add this for the following reasons:

      * Instagram is about your life on the go â€“ we hope to encourage photos
        from within the app.
      * We want to fight spam & low quality photos. Once we allow uploading
        from other sources, it's harder to control what comes into the Instagram
        ecosystem. All this being said, we're working on ways to ensure users
        have a consistent and high-quality experience on our platform.

        The returned type key will allow you to differentiate between `image`
        and `video` media.

        Note: if you authenticate with an OAuth Token, you will receive the
        `user_has_liked` key which quickly tells you whether the current user
        has liked this media item.
